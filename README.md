## 🚀 Key Features
- Dynamic scientific hypothesis generation
- Multi-agent research exploration
- Real-time progress tracking
- Iterative research cycles
- Cross-domain research support

## 🔬 How It Works
The AI Scientific Hypothesis Generator uses a sophisticated multi-agent system to explore research questions:

1. **Hypothesis Generation**: Create initial scientific hypotheses
2. **Hypothesis Reflection**: Critically analyze generated hypotheses
3. **Hypothesis Ranking**: Evaluate hypotheses based on scientific merit
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Progressively improve research insights

### Research Iteration Workflow
- Users can select 1-5 research iterations
- Each iteration explores the research goal from different perspectives
- Generates comprehensive, nuanced research insights

## 💻 Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, Tailwind CSS, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **AI Components**: Multi-agent language model interactions
- **Event Streaming**: Server-Sent Events (SSE)

## 🛠 Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
